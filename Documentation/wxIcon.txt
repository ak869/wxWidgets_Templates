// Method 1: load from XPM data
#include "icon1.xpm"
wxIcon app_icon1(icon1_xpm);

// Method 2: load from an ICO resource (Windows and OS/2 only)
wxIcon app_icon2(wxT("icon2"));

// Method 3: load from an ICO file (Windows and OS/2 only)
wxIcon app_icon3(wxT("icon3.ico"), wxBITMAP_TYPE_ICO, 16, 16);

// Method 4: create from a bitmap
wxIcon app_icon4;
wxBitmap bitmap4(wxT("icon4.png"), wxBITMAP_TYPE_PNG);
app_icon4.CopyFromBitmap(bitmap4);
